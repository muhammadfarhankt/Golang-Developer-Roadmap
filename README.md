# Golang Developer Roadmap

## 1. Learn the Golang fundamentals

- Go Tour: Start with the official Go Tour to get familiar with the language syntax and features. Visit A Tour of Go to begin.
- W3Schools: Utilize W3Schools' Go tutorial for a structured introduction to the language. Visit W3Schools Go Tutorial to get started.
- Video Tutorials: If you prefer video learning, check out this tutorial from Freecodecamp: Go Programming â€“ Golang Course with Bonus Projects. (Watch the first few chapters up to slices).
- Learn by doing. Install golang on your system or start by doing Golang Online compilers.
- GeeksforGeeks: Dive deeper into Golang fundamentals on [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/golang/) for comprehensive learning.
- Short Variable Declaration: Utilize the short declaration syntax (:=) to declare variables without assigning garbage values. Defaults to zero (0) or false for boolean.
- Loop Types: Master different loop types including range loops and understand loop approaches (while, do while, infinite loop).
- Arrays vs Slices: Differentiate between arrays and slices, focusing on capacity management and slice behavior on overflow. Understand that slices are built on top of arrays and provide a more flexible way to work with data collections. When a slice's capacity is exceeded, Go automatically doubles the underlying array's size to accommodate additional elements. This dynamic resizing ensures efficient memory usage and allows slices to grow dynamically as needed.
- Strings in Go: Learn about the string data type, byte vs rune, immutability, and string manipulation techniques.
- Functions: Explore the flexibility of functions in Go, including returning multiple data types and variadic functions.
- Initialising a project. `go mod init <project name>`
- Maps and Structs: Explore Go's map and struct data types, including declaration, manipulation, size, and capacity.

## 2. Now it's time to learn Golang special features

- Understanding Go: Explore the reasons behind Go's creation and its design philosophy.
- _(underscore) indentifier.
- Packages and Modules: Understand Go's package system, including importing/exporting packages. Practice writing functions in other packages and importing them. Remember to capitalize function names for exporting.
- Error Handling: Treat errors as a data type and learn effective error handling techniques.
- Understand following new vs make, GO Path and GO Root
- Goroutines and Channels: Learn about Go's powerful concurrency features, including goroutines and channels.
- OOP Concepts in Go: Understand how Go implements object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and whether it follows OOP or procedural programming (POP) paradigms.
- Defer: Understand the defer statement and its role in handling function execution flow.
- Concurrency vs Parallelism: Differentiate between concurrency and parallelism in the context of Go programming.
